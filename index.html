            Hi, my name is Nathanael and I am a driven web developer that is
            always trying to learn new things and improve my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2023 to 2025 I worked full time while attending Portland
            Community College and graduated with an associates degree in Web
            Development and Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            While was in school I built excellent fundamentals working
            extensively with <span class="tech-span">HTML</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">CSS</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Javascript</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">PHP</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">SQL</span>. I have dabbled with
            <span class="tech-span">C</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Rust</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">C#</span>, and have a solid understanding of
            low level concepts, OOP, and functional programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of my classes and my job, I worked constantly on personal
            projects and tried to learn as much as I could. I built larger
            things like
            <a href="https://github.com/Nathanael-Allen/books_site" class="link"
              >full stack web applications</a
            >
            with <span class="tech-span">Node.js</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Express</span>,
            <span class="tech-span"> Sqlite</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">HTMX</span>. But I also did smaller things
            like basic automation scripts with
            <span class="tech-span">Python</span> or setting up virtual private
            servers with <span class="tech-span">SSH</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">Bash</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I wasn't working on personal projects I was building
            <a href="https://coreassociations.com/" class="link">sites</a> for
            people to market their business. Or help them build logic intensive
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Nathanael-Allen/cyber_savage_beta"
              class="link"
              >tools</a
            > 
            for their table top games using 
            <span class="tech-span">Typescript</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">React</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Tailwind.css</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">Vite</span>. I
            either host these on a virtual private server that I manage or
            statically on Github Pages or Cloudflare Pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to web development I strive to accomplish every goal
            or deliverable in the simplest, most elegant way I can. Many
            developers are reaching for large frameworks to build simple static
            sites, I am a big advocate for starting simple and adding in the
            complexity only when it is absolutely necessary. If I can build a
            simple tool myself without adding a big
            <span class="tech-span">NPM</span> library to my project I will, but
            I also know when to reach for something like
            <span class="tech-span">React</span> when the project needs it.
