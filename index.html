            Hi, my name is Nathanael and I am a driven
            <span class="tech-span">full stack web developer</span> that is
            always trying to learn new things and improve my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2023 to 2025 I worked full time while attending Portland
            Community College and graduated with an associates degree in Web
            Development and Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            While was in school I built excellent fundamentals working
            extensively with <span class="tech-span">HTML</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">CSS</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Javascript</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">PHP</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">SQL</span>. I have dabbled with
            <span class="tech-span">C</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Rust</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">C#</span>, and have a solid understanding of
            low level concepts, OOP, and functional programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of my classes and my job, I worked constantly on personal
            projects and tried to learn as much as I could. I built larger
            things like
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Nathanael-Allen/books_site"
              class="link"
              target="_blank"
              >full stack web applications</a
            >
            with <span class="tech-span">Node.js</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Express</span>,
            <span class="tech-span"> Sqlite</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">HTMX</span>. But I also did smaller things
            like basic automation scripts with
            <span class="tech-span">Python</span> or setting up virtual private
            servers with <span class="tech-span">SSH</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">Bash</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I wasn't working on personal projects I was building
            <a href="https://cyber-savage.com/" class="link">sites</a> for
            people to market their business. Or help them build logic intensive
            <a
              href="https://github.com/Nathanael-Allen/cyber_savage_beta"
              class="link"
              >tools</a
            >
            for their table top games using
            <span class="tech-span">Typescript</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">React</span>,
            <span class="tech-span">Tailwind.css</span>, and
            <span class="tech-span">Vite</span>. I either host these on a
            virtual private server that I manage or statically on Github Pages
            or Cloudflare Pages.

          <p>
            When it comes to web development I strive to accomplish every goal
            and solve problems in the simplest, most elegant way I can. I have focused on making my skill set broad instead of specializing in a single framework or CMS. I am always ready to learn new technologies and adapt to new challenges.

            I built this

              >force builder</a
            >
            application, as well as the <a href="cyber-savage.com" class="link">website</a> for the indie table top skirmish game "Cyber Savage".
            The builder is a fairly big
            <span class="tech-span">React</span> application and I have been
            working on for over six months with a couple of talented table top
            game designers. It is very logic intensive application with a lot of
            state management and deeply nested objects. The application is still
            being actively developed and is updated frequently with rule changes
            to the game.

                This project is being hosted on Cloudflare Pages. I used
                <span class="tech-span">Tailwind.css</span> for styling components,
                <span class="tech-span">Vite</span> for building, and
                <span class="tech-span">Typescript</span> for all the code. The
                github repository can be found

            <p>The website was built using <span class="tech-span">Laravel/PHP</span>, <span class="tech-span">Tailwind</span>, <span class="tech-span">Blade</span>, <span class="tech-span">HTMX</span>, and <span class="tech-span">Sqlite</span>. It is hosted on a Linode VPS and I use Laravel Forge to manage it.</p>

            This is a small marketing site I built for an HOA management
            company. It is hosted
            <a href="https://coreassociations.com/" class="link" target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >
            on a Linode VPS that I fully manage. I built a simple backend with
            <span class="tech-span">Express</span> and
            <span class="tech-span">Node.js</span> to render
            <span class="tech-span">EJS</span> templates and handle the contact
            form submissions.

          <p>
            This site will be updated to have more functionality and integration
            with their other services soon.
